  # Required for manager accounts only: Specify the login customer ID used to

  # make sure fetch a new copy of the service after each time you change the

  # call client.logger = your_logger, which will override all these options and
  # use your custom logger instead, exactly as you configured it.

  # By default, only log warnings or errors. You can change this to 'INFO' to
  # log all requests and responses from the server.
  # Valid values are 'FATAL', 'ERROR', 'WARN', 'INFO', and 'DEBUG'

  # along to the logger.
  # You can provide a filename as a String, an IO object like STDOUT or STDERR,
  # or an open file.
