        # This method finds the first line from the current stack trace that
        # doesn't originate from lib/google/ads/google_ads. It does this by
        # running backwards through the current stack trace in chunks. The
        # reason for this is that pulling the entire stack trace is O(n) on
        # the depth of the stack (which is in practice very expensive in Rails
        # applications, because rails ads a lot stack frames on to every
        # request).
        #
        # The chunking algorithm works by skipping a certain number of frames,
        # and then pulling a static number, consider a stack trace as folows,
        # where frame 17 is the one we're interested in, and we're actually,
        # thousands of frames deep.

        #
        # the first iteration of this will skip frames 0-2 and pull frames
        # 3-7 (skip_frames = 3, increment = 5, 3 + 5 -1 = 7). Skipping is free,
        # and pulling chunks is O(n) on the size of the chunk.

        #
        # if the relevant stack frame isn't found, skip is incremented, to
        # point at frame 8, and the increment is doubled, doubling the size
        # of the search window, causing it to point at frame 17

        # here, we've performed 15 lookup operations to find the item we're

        # strategy is that pulling stack frames has some fixed overhead, and so
        # in practice, doing a linear scan from frame 0 to the one we're interested
        # in is also slower than this methodology, even though the doubling
        # strategy may result in strictly more lookups thn necessary.
