 - Removed the symbol based lookup util, favoring a method based one:
   ```ruby
   # instead of
   client.service(:Campaign)
   client.resource(:Campaign)
   client.operation(:Campaign)
   # we now use
   client.service.campaign
   client.resource.campaign
   client.operation.campaign
   ```

   however, path method helpers still use a symbol based lookup:
   ```ruby
   client.path(:V1).campaign(...)
   client.path(:V2).campaign(...)
   ```

   see https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/client-libs/ruby/factories
   for full documentation
 - Moved default version of the API to v2, to continue using v1, apply
   the version number to your factories calls:
   ```ruby
   client.service.v1.campaign
   client.operation.v1.campaign
   ```
