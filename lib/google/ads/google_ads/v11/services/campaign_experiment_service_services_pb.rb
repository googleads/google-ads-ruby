            # CampaignExperimentService manages the life cycle of campaign experiments.
            # It is used to create new experiments from drafts, modify experiment
            # properties, promote changes in an experiment back to its base campaign,
            # graduate experiments into new stand-alone campaigns, and to remove an
            # experiment.
            #
            # An experiment consists of two variants or arms - the base campaign and the
            # experiment campaign, directing a fixed share of traffic to each arm.
            # A campaign experiment is created from a draft of changes to the base campaign
            # and will be a snapshot of changes in the draft at the time of creation.
