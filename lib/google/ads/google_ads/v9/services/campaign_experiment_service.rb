          # CampaignExperimentService manages the life cycle of campaign experiments.
          # It is used to create new experiments from drafts, modify experiment
          # properties, promote changes in an experiment back to its base campaign,
          # graduate experiments into new stand-alone campaigns, and to remove an
          # experiment.
          #
          # An experiment consists of two variants or arms - the base campaign and the
          # experiment campaign, directing a fixed share of traffic to each arm.
          # A campaign experiment is created from a draft of changes to the base campaign
          # and will be a snapshot of changes in the draft at the time of creation.
          #
