          # A service for managing account-level budgets via proposals.
          #
          # A proposal is a request to create a new budget or make changes to an
          # existing one.
          #
          # Reads for account-level budgets managed by these proposals will be
          # supported in a future version. Until then, please use the
          # BudgetOrderService from the AdWords API. Learn more at
          # https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/budget-order
          #
          # Mutates:
          # The CREATE operation creates a new proposal.
          # UPDATE operations aren't supported.
          # The REMOVE operation cancels a pending proposal.
          #
