    # A service for managing account-level budgets via proposals.
    #
    # A proposal is a request to create a new budget or make changes to an
    # existing one.
    #
    # Reads for account-level budgets managed by these proposals will be
    # supported in a future version. Until then, please use the
    # BudgetOrderService from the AdWords API. Learn more at
    # https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/budget-order

    # Mutates:
    # The CREATE operation creates a new proposal.
    # UPDATE operations aren't supported.
    # The REMOVE operation cancels a pending proposal.
