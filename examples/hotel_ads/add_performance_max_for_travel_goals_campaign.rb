# This example shows how to create a Performance Max for travel goals campaign.
# It also uses TravelAssetSuggestionService to fetch suggested assets for
# creating an asset group. In case there are not enough assets for the asset
# group (required by Performance Max), this example will create more assets to
# fulfill the requirements.
#
# For more information about Performance Max campaigns, see
# https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/performance-max/overview.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - You must have at least one conversion action in the account.
# For more about conversion actions, see
# https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/conversions/overview#conversion_actions.
#
# Notes:
# - This example uses the default customer conversion goals.
#   For an example of setting campaign-specific conversion goals, see
#   shopping_ads/add_performance_max_retail_campaign.rb
# - To learn how to create asset group signals, see
#   advanced_perations/add_performance_max_campaign.rb
