# This example uses Customer Match to create a new user list (a.k.a. audience)
# and adds users to it.
#
# This feature is only available to accounts that meet the requirements described at
#     https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6299717.
#
# Note: It may take up to several hours for the list to be populated with users.
# Email addresses must be associated with a Google account.
# For privacy purposes, the user list size will show as zero until the list has
# at least 1,000 users. After that, the size will be rounded to the two most
# significant digits.
